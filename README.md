# Heuristic Evaluation of an Existing Website or App

This experiment involves evaluating an existing website or mobile application using Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics. The goal is to identify usability problems in a structured and objective way and provide actionable recommendations for improvement.

---

## Objective

To analyze an existing interface by applying heuristic evaluation methods and to document usability issues, their severity, and potential design improvements.

### Aim

- To perform a heuristic evaluation of a real-world website or application.
- To identify violations of established usability principles.
- To suggest design changes that improve the user experience.

### Tools and Resources

- Evaluation Form Template (Google Sheets or Excel)
- Screenshot Tool (e.g., Lightshot, Snipping Tool)
- Website/App Access (e.g., LinkedIn, Airbnb, local banking app)
- Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics Reference

## Procedure and Steps

1. **Select a Website or App**
   - Choose a publicly accessible platform or app.
   - Preferably select one you use regularly or that has known usability challenges.

2. **Define Scope**
   - Identify specific pages or user flows to evaluate (e.g., signup, search, checkout).
   - Limit the scope to 3–5 key screens or tasks for a focused evaluation.

3. **Understand the Heuristics**
   - Review Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics:
     1. Visibility of system status
     2. Match between system and the real world
     3. User control and freedom
     4. Consistency and standards
     5. Error prevention
     6. Recognition rather than recall
     7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
     8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
     9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
     10. Help and documentation

4. **Evaluate the UI**
   - Navigate the app or website.
   - Observe and record where heuristic violations occur.
   - Take screenshots for each violation.

5. **Document Findings**
   - Use a template to log:
     - The violated heuristic
     - Description of the issue
     - Screenshot or example
     - Severity rating (0 = No issue, 4 = Usability catastrophe)
     - Suggested improvement

6. **Summarize and Reflect**
   - Count and categorize all issues by heuristic.
   - Identify patterns and critical usability flaws.
   - Provide general recommendations for improvement.
